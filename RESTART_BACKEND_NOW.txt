⚠️ BACKEND RESTART REQUIRED ⚠️

The database is set up correctly, but your backend server needs to restart!

HOW TO RESTART:

1. Find the terminal/window where your backend is running
   (You should see logs like "Server running on http://...")

2. Press Ctrl+C to stop it

3. Run this command:
   npm run dev

4. Refresh your browser

That's it! The 500 error will be gone.

ALTERNATIVE: If you can't find the backend terminal, just run:
   cd backend
   npm run dev

This will start a new backend instance.
